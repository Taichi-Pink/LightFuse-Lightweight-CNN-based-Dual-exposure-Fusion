* Download data from [SICE dataset](https://github.com/csjcai/SICE).
* Place Dataset_Part1 into ```Dataset``` folder.
* run sort_ev.py to get the value of the lowest and the hightest exposed image. Please note that we use the average pixel value to represent the approximate exposure value for each image.
* Split the data in Dataset_Part1 into the train (80%) and test (20%) folder.
